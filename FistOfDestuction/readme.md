## üîç Purpose

This emulator is designed to:
	‚Ä¢	Identify extreme edge conditions, such as the appearance of rare bonus rounds and maximum win events.
	‚Ä¢	Validate consistency of these outcomes over multiple iterations.
	‚Ä¢	Empirically approximate key slot parameters such as RTP (Return To Player) with high efficiency.

‚∏ª

## üéØ Key Features
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Simulation of full game mechanics including bonus rounds, wild features, and maximum payout conditions.
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Detection of the payout threshold breach (e.g., one-spin win exceeding manufacturer-set limits).
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Stability check over five consecutive iterations to ensure statistical reliability.
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ No maximum win cap to allow unbounded analysis of outlier payouts.
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Designed to reduce the number of spins required to analyze full game distribution from hundreds of millions to ~8.5 million.

## üìä Why Use This Emulator?

Traditional statistical analysis of slot games requires:
	‚Ä¢	~500 simulations of 20 million spins each to observe rare combinations at least once.
	‚Ä¢	Prohibitively long computation times for empirical modeling.

With this emulator:
	‚Ä¢	You get accelerated convergence of key metrics.
	‚Ä¢	You can empirically validate payout percentage (~98% target zone) without needing full-scale industrial simulations.
	‚Ä¢	You get insight into unrestricted game behavior‚Äîincluding rare jackpot-scale wins (e.g., 101,080√ó payout observed).

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
	1.	Simulates standard and bonus spins of the Fist of Destruction game.
	2.	Monitors for:
	‚Ä¢	Rare event triggers (e.g., Throwdown!, Ultimate Throwdown!).
	‚Ä¢	Payout exceeding limits set by the original provider.
	3.	After detecting such a point, verifies that:
	‚Ä¢	Similar behavior continues for at least 5 iterations.
	4.	Collects and logs statistical results to support further RTP and variance analysis.
